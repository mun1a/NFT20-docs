# Add your project

> This guide is written for NFT project owners. If you want to add your project to NFT20 and encounter difficulties don't hesitate to contact us on Telegram/Discord. If you want to see a project you like on NFT20 you can create a pool yourself or contact the project owners to add it and incentive liquidity.


NFT project developers can create or support the pool for their NFT project. Having a healthy pool with good liquidity on a DEX enables their users to easily trade their items together, and for new comers to get their items at a fair price. The pool can also be used as a sale mechanism for NFT projects while the pair is incentived to get high liquidity.

NFT projects featured on NFT20 will add a usecase for your NFTs, users will be able to buy and sell their NFTs in a more liquid way as well as creating arbitrage opportunities on OpenSea and other second hand markets where you can capture fees.

Also the top projects with most liquidity will be cross incentivized with your reward plus our our governance token when it is released.

## Create a pool

Creating a pool is just as easy as giving your NFT token address and sending a transaction. NFTs following the ERC721 and ERC1155 are currently supported. 

The guide for adding a pool for your project to NFT20 is [here](https://docs.nft20.io/create-pool/).

## Create a Uniswap Pool

Once the pool is created, a new contract with the ERC20 token standard wil be created. You can now add some NFTs to get those tokens or just copy the address. and go to [Uniswap and create a pool for it](https://tokenmint.io/blog/how-to-list-your-custom-erc20-token-to-uniswap.html).

## Incentivize your users to add liquidity

The next step is for you to create incentive for users to add liquidity and trade the newly created tokenized version of your NFTs. Projects reaching a high liquidity will be incentivized to receive our governance token at launch. To incentivize LP staking you can use your already made contract or standards like the ones made by:
* [Wrap LP]() 
* [Sushi swap's MasterChef](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol) 
* [Synthetix LP incentive](https://github.com/Synthetixio/Unipool/blob/master/contracts/Unipool.sol)
